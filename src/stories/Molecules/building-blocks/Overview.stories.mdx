# Molecular Building Blocks

Molecular building blocks are components that serve as sub-elements for larger, more complex molecules. These components are designed to be composed together to create complete UI patterns and workflows.

## What Goes Here

- Menu items for dropdown menus and navigation
- Table rows for data tables
- Form sections for complex forms
- Card components for lists and grids
- Navigation items for complex navigation systems

## Examples

**Currently Available:**
- **MenuItem**: Individual menu items used in dropdown menus
- **TableRow**: Individual table rows used in data tables

## Usage Guidelines

- Building blocks should be composable and reusable
- They should handle their own state when appropriate
- Designed to work together in larger molecular components
- Should maintain consistent styling and behavior patterns

## Relationship to Parent Molecules

Building blocks are typically used by their parent molecules:
- MenuItem → DropdownMenu
- TableRow → Table
- FormSection → ComplexForm

Each building block maintains the design system's consistency while providing the flexibility needed for complex compositions.
