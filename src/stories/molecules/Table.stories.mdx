# Table Components

The Table building blocks provide a comprehensive set of components for displaying tabular data with rich interactions and multiple visual states.

## Overview

The table system follows atomic design principles:

- **Atoms**: `TableRow` and `TableCell` - Basic building blocks for individual table elements
- **Molecules**: `Table` - Complete table implementation with header, body, and advanced features

## Component Architecture

### TableRow (Atom)
The foundational row component that supports:
- Multiple visual states (default, hover, selected, disabled)
- Flexible cell content with proper alignment
- Responsive behavior across screen sizes
- Accessibility features for screen readers

### TableCell (Atom)
Individual cell components that provide:
- Text content with proper typography
- Icon support for enhanced data visualization
- Alignment options (left, center, right)
- State inheritance from parent rows

### Table (Molecule)
The complete table implementation featuring:
- Sortable column headers with visual indicators
- Selectable rows with checkbox controls
- Pagination controls for large datasets
- Responsive design with horizontal scrolling
- Comprehensive keyboard navigation

## Features

### Data Display
- Clean, scannable layout for tabular information
- Consistent typography and spacing throughout
- Support for mixed content types (text, numbers, icons)
- Responsive column behavior

### Interaction States
- **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback for row-level interactions
- **Selection States**: Clear indication of selected rows
- **Disabled States**: Proper styling for inactive data
- **Focus Management**: Keyboard navigation support

### Sorting and Organization
- Column header sorting with visual indicators
- Ascending and descending sort options
- Persistent sort state across interactions
- Clear visual feedback for current sort column

### Selection and Actions
- Individual row selection with checkboxes
- Bulk selection with header controls
- Action states that respect selection context
- Clear selection indicators

## Usage Guidelines

### Data Organization
Structure your table data to prioritize the most important information in the leftmost columns. Use consistent data types within columns for better scannability.

### Column Configuration
- **Essential Columns**: Always visible columns containing primary data
- **Secondary Columns**: Additional information that can be hidden on smaller screens
- **Action Columns**: Dedicated space for row-level actions, typically right-aligned

### Responsive Behavior
Tables automatically adapt to smaller screens by:
- Prioritizing essential columns
- Implementing horizontal scroll for additional data
- Maintaining usability across all device sizes

## Best Practices

1. **Data Hierarchy**: Organize columns by importance, left to right
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent data formatting within columns
3. **Clear Headers**: Provide descriptive, scannable column headers
4. **Appropriate Density**: Balance information density with readability
5. **Action Clarity**: Make row-level and bulk actions clearly distinguishable
6. **Loading States**: Implement proper loading indicators for dynamic data
7. **Empty States**: Provide helpful messaging when tables contain no data

## Accessibility Features

The table components include comprehensive accessibility support:
- Proper semantic markup with table, th, and td elements
- ARIA labels for sortable column headers
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- High contrast support for visual accessibility

## Implementation Notes

Tables are designed to handle:
- Dynamic data loading and updates
- Large datasets with pagination
- Complex data types and formatting
- Integration with existing design systems
- Cross-browser compatibility
