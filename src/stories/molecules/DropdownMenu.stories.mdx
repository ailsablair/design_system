# Dropdown Menu Components

The dropdown menu system consists of two main components that work together to create flexible, accessible menu interfaces.

## Components Overview

### MenuItem (Atom)
The base building block for individual menu items. Supports icons, labels, different states, and accessibility features.

### DropdownMenu (Molecule)
A container component that organizes multiple MenuItems into a cohesive dropdown interface with proper spacing, borders, and shadows.

## Features

- **Flexible Item Configuration**: Support for various menu item types including standard items, sections, and back navigation
- **Size Variants**: Small, default, and large sizes to fit different contexts
- **State Management**: Hover, active, and disabled states for all menu items
- **Icon Support**: Optional leading and trailing icons for enhanced visual hierarchy
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts gracefully to different screen sizes

## Usage Guidelines

### Basic Menu Structure
Use the basic DropdownMenu for simple navigation scenarios with uniform menu items.

### Submenu Navigation
When implementing hierarchical navigation, use the back navigation item type to provide clear context switching.

### Section Organization
For complex menus with multiple categories, use section headers to organize related menu items.

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Sizing**: Use the same size variant within a single interface
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Use section headers to group related functionality
3. **Meaningful Icons**: Only include icons when they add clarity to the menu item's purpose
4. **Accessible Labels**: Ensure all menu items have clear, descriptive text
5. **Logical Grouping**: Group related menu items together using sections

## Implementation Notes

The DropdownMenu component automatically handles:
- Proper spacing between menu items
- Border and shadow styling for container appearance
- Responsive behavior across screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- ARIA attributes for accessibility

Refer to the story examples to see these components in action with various configurations and states.
