# Extended Dropdown Menus

Extended dropdown menus provide enhanced navigation with section headers, sub-section navigation, and improved organization for complex menu structures.

## Advanced Features

- **Section Headers**: Organize menu items with labeled sections for better categorization
- **Sub-section Navigation**: Navigate through hierarchical content with contextual back buttons  
- **Size Variants**: Small, default, and large sizes available for different interface contexts
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining usability
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and comprehensive screen reader support

## Menu Types

### Sectioned Menus
Use sectioned menus to organize large sets of menu items into logical groups. Section headers provide clear visual separation and improve navigation efficiency.

### Submenu Navigation
When implementing multi-level navigation, use the submenu variant with back navigation to maintain user context and provide clear pathways between menu levels.

### Combined Patterns
For complex interfaces, combine sectioned menus with submenu navigation to create sophisticated information architectures that remain intuitive to users.

## Size Considerations

### Small Size
- Best for dense interfaces where space is limited
- Maintains readability while maximizing content density
- Ideal for secondary navigation elements

### Default Size
- Optimal for most general-purpose implementations
- Balances readability with interface efficiency
- Recommended for primary navigation scenarios

### Large Size
- Best for touch interfaces and accessibility requirements
- Provides enhanced target areas for interaction
- Ideal for interfaces prioritizing ease of use

## Implementation Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure
Use submenu navigation to implement progressive disclosure patterns, revealing additional options only when needed while keeping the primary interface clean.

### Contextual Navigation
Implement context-aware menu structures where the available options change based on the current user context or application state.

### Hierarchical Organization
Create logical hierarchies using section headers and submenu navigation to organize complex feature sets into digestible chunks.

## Accessibility Considerations

Extended dropdown menus maintain full accessibility support including:
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys, Enter, and Escape
- Screen reader announcements for section changes and navigation context
- Focus management during menu transitions
- ARIA attributes for proper semantic structure

## Best Practices for Extended Menus

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group related functionality under meaningful section headers
2. **Consistent Navigation**: Use consistent back navigation patterns across all submenus
3. **Clear Context**: Provide clear visual and textual indicators of current menu context
4. **Efficient Pathways**: Design menu structures that minimize the number of levels users must navigate
5. **Predictable Behavior**: Ensure menu behavior is consistent across all sections and levels
