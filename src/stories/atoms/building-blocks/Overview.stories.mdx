# Atomic Building Blocks

Atomic building blocks are the smallest, most fundamental UI elements that serve as components for larger atoms or molecules. These elements are typically used internally by other components rather than directly in applications.

## What Goes Here

- Sub-components used by larger atoms
- Internal UI elements that don't stand alone
- Primitive elements that combine to form complete components

## Examples

- Individual toggle switches used in toggle groups
- Single slider units used in progressive sliders
- Basic form field elements
- Primitive button states

## Usage Guidelines

- Building blocks should be simple and focused on a single purpose
- They should be designed to work together seamlessly
- Most building blocks are not intended for direct use in applications
- They serve as the foundation for more complex components

Building blocks maintain the same design token standards and accessibility requirements as all other components in the system.
