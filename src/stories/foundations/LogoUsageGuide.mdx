# ECHO Logo Usage Guide

The ECHO logo is a distinctive brand mark that represents our identity. This guide provides comprehensive instructions for proper logo usage across all applications.

## Logo Variants

### Logomark
The ECHO logomark is a circular symbol featuring geometric elements that can be used independently when space is limited or when the brand name is well-established in context.

**Best for:**
- Favicon and app icons
- Social media profile images
- Compact navigation elements
- Button icons
- Merchandise and branded items

### Wordmark
The ECHO wordmark consists of clean, modern typography spelling "ECHO" and should be used when the symbol alone might not provide sufficient brand recognition.

**Best for:**
- Text-heavy layouts
- Small horizontal spaces
- Email signatures
- Forms and headers

### Full Logo
The complete logo combines both the logomark and wordmark, providing maximum brand recognition and impact.

**Best for:**
- Primary brand applications
- Marketing materials
- Website headers
- Business cards and letterhead
- Large-format applications

## Color Variations

### Brand Colors (Default)
The multi-color brand version uses our signature color palette:
- **Primary**: Sky Blue (#0BA7EA)
- **Secondary**: Purple (#3A3282) 
- **Tertiary**: Blue (#2F42BD)

Use this version whenever possible for maximum brand impact.

### Single Color Versions
For situations where full-color reproduction isn't possible:

- **Dark Blue**: Use on light backgrounds
- **Sky Blue**: For brand consistency in monochrome applications
- **Black**: For high-contrast applications
- **White**: For dark backgrounds and overlays

## Size Guidelines

### Minimum Sizes
- **Logomark**: 24px minimum width
- **Wordmark**: 120px minimum width
- **Full Logo**: 160px minimum width

### Recommended Sizes
- **Small**: Navigation bars, compact headers
- **Medium**: Standard web applications, documents
- **Large**: Hero sections, marketing materials

## Clear Space
Maintain adequate clear space around the logo equal to the height of one "E" in the wordmark. This ensures the logo has proper visual breathing room and isn't crowded by other elements.

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ Do:
- Use the brand color version whenever possible
- Maintain proper proportions when scaling
- Ensure adequate contrast with background
- Use appropriate variants for different contexts
- Keep sufficient clear space around the logo

### ❌ Don't:
- Stretch or distort the logo proportions
- Use low-resolution versions
- Place on busy or conflicting backgrounds
- Rotate or modify the logo elements
- Use colors not specified in the brand palette
- Place text too close to the logo

## Background Usage

### Light Backgrounds
Use dark-blue, black, or brand color versions on light backgrounds with sufficient contrast.

### Dark Backgrounds  
Use the white version on dark backgrounds to ensure proper visibility and contrast.

### Photographic Backgrounds
When placing the logo over photography:
- Use the white version with a subtle drop shadow
- Ensure the background area has sufficient contrast
- Consider using a subtle overlay for better legibility

## File Formats

- **SVG**: Preferred for web and scalable applications
- **PNG**: Use with transparent backgrounds when SVG isn't supported
- **High-resolution**: Always use crisp, high-quality versions

## Accessibility

- Ensure minimum contrast ratios are met (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Provide alternative text for screen readers
- Test visibility across different devices and viewing conditions
- Consider colorblind users when choosing background colors

## Examples in Context

The logo has been designed to work harmoniously across various applications while maintaining brand consistency and professional appearance. Refer to the Storybook examples to see proper implementation in different scenarios.
