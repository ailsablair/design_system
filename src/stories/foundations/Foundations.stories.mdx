# Design System Foundations

This section contains the foundational elements of our design system, including:

- **Design Tokens** - Colors, typography, spacing, and other core values
- **Typography** - Font families, weights, sizes, and text styles  
- **Color Palette** - Primary, secondary, and semantic color schemes
- **Spacing System** - Consistent spacing and sizing values
- **Icons** - Icon library and usage guidelines

## Getting Started

These foundations serve as the building blocks for all components in the design system. They ensure consistency and maintainability across all user interfaces.
