# Foundation Building Blocks

Foundation building blocks are the most primitive elements that underpin our entire design system. These are the core visual and behavioral elements that all other components depend on.

## What Goes Here

- Base typography elements (headings, body text, captions)
- Primitive color swatches and gradients
- Basic spacing and layout utilities
- Core animation and transition elements
- Fundamental shape and border utilities

## Usage Guidelines

- Foundation building blocks are rarely used directly in applications
- They serve as the base layer for all atoms and molecules
- Should be extremely stable and rarely change
- Must maintain perfect consistency across the system

## Relationship to Design Tokens

Foundation building blocks are the visual representation of our design tokens:
- Color building blocks demonstrate color tokens
- Typography building blocks show type scale tokens
- Spacing building blocks visualize spacing tokens

## Future Additions

As the design system grows, foundation building blocks might include:
- Primitive icon elements
- Basic interaction patterns
- Core accessibility utilities
- Brand visual elements

These elements form the bedrock of our design system's visual consistency.
