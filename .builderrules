This is a design system for the nuclear power industry. It is being built with React, Typescript and Javascript. We want to use the MUI 6 library as a basis for all of our custom components. The only design tokens that should be used are the custom ones pushed via Figma. Do not use any of the MUI library tokens for colour, sizing and spacing, effects and typography.

We are attempting to make Echo as simple as possible, given the very complex subject matter in nuclear power. 

Echo is a collection of reusable components and clear standards designed to help teams build beautiful, consistent, and accessible user experiences efficiently.

Where possible, we should reassess the code that has already been written and see if there is a way to improve it alongside any new UI element additions.
