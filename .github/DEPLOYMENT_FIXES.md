# GitHub Pages Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Primary Issue: Import Error in SplitButton.stories.tsx**
- **Problem**: `"SplitButtonMenuItem" is not exported by "src/stories/atoms/SplitButton.tsx"`
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript import/export issue during build process
- **Solution**: Changed from named import to type-only import:
  ```typescript
  // Before (causing build failure)
  import { SplitButton, SplitButtonMenuItem } from './SplitButton';
  
  // After (working)
  import { SplitButton } from './SplitButton';
  import type { SplitButtonMenuItem } from './SplitButton';
  ```

### 2. **Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflows**

#### Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml`:
- ✅ Added comprehensive environment verification
- ✅ Added TypeScript validation step
- ✅ Enhanced build verification with detailed checks
- ✅ Added non-blocking linting (warnings only)
- ✅ Improved error handling and debugging output
- ✅ Added deployment summary with metrics

#### Updated `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml`:
- ✅ Added TypeScript validation
- ✅ Enhanced environment verification
- ✅ Added build test before Chromatic deployment
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Added build metrics and summaries

#### New `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`:
- ✅ Created dedicated PR testing workflow
- ✅ Tests both Storybook and Vite builds
- ✅ Validates TypeScript and linting
- ✅ Catches issues early in development

### 3. **Code Quality Improvements**
- ✅ Fixed unused variable warnings in Card.tsx
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript type imports
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in ResizeObserver utils

## Workflow Structure

```
Pull Request → Build Test Workflow
     ↓
Main Branch Push → Deploy Storybook + Chromatic Workflows
     ↓
GitHub Pages Deployment
```

## Build Verification

The workflows now verify:
1. ✅ **Dependencies Installation**: `npm ci` completes successfully
2. ✅ **TypeScript Validation**: `tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` passes
3. ✅ **Storybook Build**: `npm run build-storybook` succeeds
4. ✅ **Output Verification**: Required files exist in `storybook-static/`
5. ✅ **Artifact Upload**: Pages deployment artifacts are valid

## Expected Deployment Process

1. **On Push to Main/Mystic-Garden**:
   - Deploy Storybook workflow runs
   - Chromatic visual testing runs
   - Both workflows should now complete successfully

2. **On Pull Request**:
   - Build test workflow runs
   - Chromatic runs for visual review
   - Catches issues before merge

## Troubleshooting

If future deployments fail:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for TypeScript errors or import issues
2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all packages install correctly
3. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run build-storybook` locally first
4. **Check Workflow Status**: Use the enhanced debugging output

## Next Steps

- Monitor next few deployments to ensure stability
- All future commits should trigger successful deployments
- Visual regression testing via Chromatic is now more reliable
